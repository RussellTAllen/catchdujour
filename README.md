ðŸš§ This is a technical demo
  - Released to a small amount of users
  - This is not intended to be the next Reddit
  
# How it works
  - Users are able to create their own "catches" (posts) and categorize them by "catchegory".  Each user has their own personal page, displaying all of their catches and the catchegories that they have made posts in
  - Users can filter out catchegories they are not interested in
  - Users are able to follow others
